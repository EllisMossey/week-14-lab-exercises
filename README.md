### Objective get networking and CI working

- [ ] Create VPC: `10.0.0.0/22`
- [ ] Get Github actions to deploy your IaC

- [ ] Create Pub subnets:
  - [ ] a: `10.0.0.0/24`
  - [ ] b: `10.0.1.0/24`
- [ ] Create Pvt Subnets:
  - [ ] a: `10.0.2.0/24`
- [ ] Create IGW
- [ ] Create Public Route Tables
- [ ] Create NAT gateway
- [ ] Create Private Route Table

### Objective create secondary infra

- [ ] Clickops a `t3.micro` instance in a public subnet with port 22 open and ssh in
- [ ] Delete that instance and script a `t3.micro` instance into the private subnet
- [ ] Create Network load balancer (NLB)
- [ ] Connect load balancer to instance
- [ ] Deploy application to private instance
